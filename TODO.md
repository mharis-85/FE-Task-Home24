## TODO:

I tried to complete most of the things as i can in given time.

Still, few improvements can be done

## CSS in Js

Due to less time couldn't migrate my css file to emotion.js [Css in js/styled components].

## webpack configuration

Since app bundle was small. So didn't integrated webpack.config for build and other utilities like code splitting.

## State Management

Since its was single api object consisting of Categories []array. So i didn't implemented Redux/Context api as data wasn't large. But for scalibilty we can use context with custom provider hook or redux depends upon conditions

## Test

Test cases can be improved too. Both unit and end to end testing can be done .

## Deployment
only client side is deployed on vercel. But Backend couldn't be deployed to do api calls
