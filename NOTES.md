## github: https://github.com/mharis-85/FE-Task-Home24

i deployed my client app to vercel. As production build i couldn't access your proxy server endpoint. My post request returned HTTP(405):method not allowed. May be what i need to do was to deploy your node(express) server too. which i couldn't.
